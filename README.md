# Selenium Mini Projects
This repository contains past works on learning Selenium WebDriver with python API. Tasks that could be done with the scripts are mostly trivial but in my opinion can be automated(hence the script). Scripts are not perfect in the sense that it could perform the tasks as fast as possible, however with stable internet connection I believe it should work as intended.

Finished project (still open for future fixes) :
- Automated Shopee.sg coin collector.

Future project :
- Scrape

## Requires :
- python
- selenium
